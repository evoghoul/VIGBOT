# VIGBOT: Autonomous AI Campus Assistant (VFSTR Vadlamudi)

An autonomous, production-grade AI academic assistant and helpdesk built for **Vignan's Foundation for Science, Technology and Research (VFSTR :: Vadlamudi)**. Grounded in official institutional bylaws, academic records, attendance percentages, timetable slots, exam schedules, and the **2026-27 Semester-I B.Tech Academic Calendar**.

VIGBOT pairs verified institutional database lookups, 28 verified application capabilities, and security guardrails with a **23-Tool Knowledge Graph Registry**, an algorithmic **Dijkstra Campus Navigation Graph**, and a **sub-millisecond CPU-bound Intent Classifier** (TF-IDF Word + Subword Character N-Grams + Multinomial Logistic Regression) for high-speed intent routing and crisis safety.

## 🌐 Live Production Deployment

VIGBOT is fully deployed and operational across cloud infrastructure:

| Component | Platform | Live URL / Identifier | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **Frontend Web App** | Vercel (Next.js 16 Turbopack) | **[student-helpdesk-agent-five.vercel.app](https://student-helpdesk-agent-five.vercel.app)** | **LIVE** |
| **Backend API** | Render (FastAPI Docker) | **[vigbot-api.onrender.com](https://vigbot-api.onrender.com)** | **LIVE** |
| **Database** | Neon (Lakebase Postgres) | `vigbot-db` (Branch: `production`) | **LIVE** |
| **Interactive API Docs** | Swagger UI (FastAPI) | **[vigbot-api.onrender.com/docs](https://vigbot-api.onrender.com/docs)** | **LIVE** |

## Key Highlights & Production Status

- **Live Cloud Database on Neon Lakebase Postgres**: Decoupled serverless storage running on AWS US East (Ohio), fully seeded with 315 students, 22 faculty, 977 attendance logs, 2,922 marks records, 4,944 timetable slots, and institutional knowledge tables.
- **Answer-First Rule & 23-Tool Registry**: Every factual query provides a direct, verifiable answer in the first sentence with structured data badges and source citations.
- **Campus Spatial Directory & Dijkstra Navigation Graph**:
  - Algorithmic pathfinding across 23 campus nodes and 18 directed edges from Main Gate (Node 0) to Convocation Hall, NTR Library, MHP Canteen, Zest Supermarket, N-Block, E-Block, and U-Block.
  - **N-Block**: Computer Science & Engineering Block (housing 2nd and 3rd-year senior students in CSE, CS, and AI/ML), located on Path Beta **just beside Zest**, directly facing Vignan Vihar Boys Hostel (~240m from Main Gate).
  - **Zest (Supermarket)**: Central on-campus supermarket catering to daily student necessities, groceries, and stationery, located along Path Alpha immediately adjacent to MHP Canteen on the right.
  - **Intelligent Query Adaptation**: Strict distinction between **Informational Building Inquiries** (*"What is N-Block?"* $\to$ structured block profile with cohorts, departments, and facilities) versus **Directional Navigation** (*"Where is N-Block?"* $\to$ step-by-step turn-by-turn walking route).
- **Row-Level Security (RLS) & Cross-Student Privacy Guardrail**:
  - Enforces strict **Clause 2.1 - Row-Level Access Control (RLAC)**. Students can only query and view their own verified academic records (attendance, marks, CGPA, fees, profile).
  - Blocks cross-student snooping attempts by name (e.g. *"what is the attendance of Ayush Kumar?"*) or registration number (e.g. `251FA04E69`), preventing data leakage.
  - Full support for Vignan registration number patterns (`251FA04E13`, `251FA04E69`, `251FA04131`, `251FA04D46`, etc.).
  - Sickness / medical distress interceptor providing immediate guidance to the **Campus Health Clinic / Student Wellness Center** (Room 102, Student Activity Building) and 24/7 emergency medical support (+91-98765-43210).
- **Module-Grounded Institutional Truth**:
  - **Central Library**: Open Sundays from 09:00 AM to 05:00 PM (09:00 - 17:00) for reading rooms and digital study spaces.
  - **Hostel Mess Facilities**: Decentralized internal dining halls located on the ground floor of each individual hostel building.
  - **Hostel Bus Shuttles**: Verified morning (07:45 AM - 11:35 AM) and evening return (01:45 PM - 09:00 PM) schedules for KM, Villas SP, and AP/AR/AA/AO routes.
  - **Lost Student ID Replacement**: Authoritative 2-phase state machine (Phase 1: Digital report on sidebar board $\to$ Phase 2: Administrative replacement in H-Block Ground Floor Room H-G04, ₹100 challan, 2-day turnaround).
- **28 Verified Application Capabilities & 48 Operations**: Full bidirectional integration between conversational AI and 28 frontend tabs/routes (Lost & Found, Facility Bookings, Attendance, SGRC Grievance, Student Services, Fee Management, Exams, Hostels, Transport, etc.).
- **Zero False Writes & Zero Fabricated Tickets**: Strict distinction between *asking* and *doing*. Informational inquiries ("where do I report...", "how do I book...") never mutate the database, never fabricate tracking numbers, and provide direct one-click navigation pills.
- **Low-Latency Intent Classification**: Zero-cost, CPU-bound ML intent classifier (~1-2ms on standard CPU) across 18 specialized domain intents with dynamic confidence thresholding and graceful fallback.
- **22+1 Official Languages of India**: Full support for all 22 languages recognized under the 8th Schedule of the Constitution of India plus English, with real-time clickable dropdown and instant search filter.
- **Zero-Delay Mental Health Crisis Guardrail**: Asymmetric safety thresholding for `distress_support` ($\ge 99\%$ recall target) triggering immediate confidential escalation (Tele-MANAS & Crisis Counseling) without ever routing to cloud LLMs.
